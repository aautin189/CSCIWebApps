APPROACH:

After some trial and error, I figured out the quickest way to approach this assignment. 

I used the printed Lab #2 documents to re-write the baseline html code for the blog. This was before we linked to any of the css in a separate file. This gave me an idea of the structure of the content and how I needed to conceptualize individual components of that page.



DAILIES:

=============

=============
- Want to use the concept of (12) columns to resize my images.  

- Want to reposition the Home button to the right of the nav bar; change font

- Change font of Title header to something more appealing

- All fonts in the "About Me" section should be of a different style to differentiate from the main content on this page

- Want to center the Intro and Ending sections, so as to close in the meat of the piece

- Add "Blog" in the nav bar to indicate where the user is currently at (position left)

- Ensure that all elements & sections & assets are mobile responsive (use Developer Tools to double check this before submission)

- Need to increase the left & right hand margins overall; especially where the text enters the page

- Add link from blog page to home page

- Branding needs to be consistent on EVERY page connected to home
