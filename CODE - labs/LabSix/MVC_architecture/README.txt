Game: Guess A Number (Labs 4-7)
Lab #6





OVERVIEW:


===================================
ITERATIONS:

Iteration #1 - Refactor with MVC architecture
Iteration #2 - Refactor with User Input Control
Iteration #3 - Define a class 'Guess'
Iteration #4 - Adding Decrements

===================================
NOTES:

- Remembered to utilize version control in this lab, so I could come back later and reload each iteration in my browser to see the differences between each modification to the source code. This will make it easier (and quicker) to see how each feature was used so that I can locate potential features I may want to implement in my own projects (homework/capstone).
