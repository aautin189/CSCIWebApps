Game: Guess A Number (Labs 4-7)
Lab #5


TO KNOW:

Now that we've decided we want this game to render inside the viewport, we're relying on our html file as the user interface. 

So we know that this is still a number guessing game. This means there will be some back and forth between the game and the user. This indicates that the game can only begin when the user interacts with the game (via some event trigger). 

Since we are designing this game ourselves, we get to decide what constitutes a trigger in this case.
