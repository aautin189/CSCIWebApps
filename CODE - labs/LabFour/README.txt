Game: Guess A Number (labs 4-7)
Lab #4



TO KNOW:
We are not using JS to access HTML elements. Everything will be rendered in the developer console, not the viewport; we'll be printing all messages into the console.

[Dynamic Console]


OVERVIEW:

This version of the game only operates within the developer console. We set up a simple script to run this game for us. 

Since JS files cannot run without being connected to an html file, we linked our js file inside a script within the html file (which was empty). Since we don't need anything to show in the browser itself, we were able to leave the html file blank. Literally everything (the logic and the printed messages) is specified as javascript instructions.
